# 3D-Object-Scanning-Registration-and-Sharing-for-Virtual-Reality-Art-Creation

This project comes as a solution for users who would like to create their own 3D models without having any prior knowledge of photogrammetry, visualize the results using a virtual reality platform, store their work and easily share it with others.

The project encapsulates a web-based user interface acting as a social media platform where users publish 3D models based on uploaded images or videos, a structure-from-motion 3D reconstruction pipeline using “Meshroom”, and a Unity-based application for VR visualization. The VR application allows users to immerse themselves alongside the reconstructed 3D objects, enabling them to inspect the models from various angles and distances.

The project's methodology combines image processing, computer vision, and VR development, resulting in a robust and user-friendly system. Throughout the development process, a thorough review of related literature was conducted to ensure the project's alignment with current advancements in VR applications and photogrammetry.

The evaluation of the system involved user feedback and usability tests, providing valuable insights into the overall effectiveness and user experience. The results demonstrate the system's ability to generate accurate 3D models and deliver an engaging VR experience to users.
